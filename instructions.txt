<h3><b>Exchange rate visualization using R packages</b><h3>
This application demonstrates how to use different R libraries to visualize exchange rates, using <i>shiny</i> and <i>shinydashboard</i> packages for user interface. 
Currency pairs, that are used for demonstration - USD/RUB, EUR/RUB, GBP/RUB (RUB - Russian Ruble).

Exchange rates are taken from Oanda.com site, using <i>getFX()</i> function from the package <i>quantmod</i>
Maximum period for plotting - 5 last years, till yesterday.

By clicking the "Exchange Rates" menu item, you can choose one of the 2 tabs, with the names of the used libraries ("googleVis" and "dygraps"). 
Each tab has its own filters, that are used to change the period of the plotting data, and control visualization properties.

<b> 1. googleVis </b>
<ul>
	<li>"Show zoom buttons" - whether to show the zoom buttons ("1d 5d 1m" and so on)</li>
	<li>"Show range selector" - whether to show the zoom range selection area (the area at the bottom of the chart)</li>
	<li>"Alpha level of the fill" - a number from 0—100 (inclusive) specifying the alpha of the fill below each line in the line graph. 100 means 100% opaque, and 0 means no fill at all. The fill 		color is the same color as the line above it.</li>
	<li>"Thickness of the lines" - a number from 0—10 (inclusive) specifying the thickness of the lines, where 0 is the thinnest.</li>
</ul>
<b> 2. dygraphs </b>
<ul>
	<li>"Step Plot" - plot series as step chart</li>
	<li>"Fill Graph" - fill in the area underneath the series</li>
	<li>"Draw Grid" - whether to display grid lines in the chart</li>
	<li>"Log Scale" - set the graph to show the y-axis in log scale.</li>
</ul>
There are also 3 value boxes on the top of the both tabs, which display the change of the exchange rates (in %) from the start date till the end date, that are selected from the date range filter (by default, the last year data is filtered).

Clicking on the button near the title in the upper left corner, you can hide or display sidebar.
